# DeepSeek Harness Reckoner — Engine Manual

All calculation happens inside one deterministic engine. You operate it with three primitives and the record markers; the engine keeps a variable table, converts values at calculation boundaries and records every step. You never parse text into numbers and never convert units yourself — you pass typed values and the engine resolves everything against the solver signatures.

## Typed values

A typed value is a JSON object. kind is part of a quantity:

- `{ "type": "number", "value": 25, "kind": "temperature", "variant": "degC" }`
- `{ "type": "number", "value": 1500, "kind": "resistance", "prefix": "kilo" }`
- `{ "type": "complex", "value": { "re": 1, "im": 2 } | { "mag": 3, "ang": 0.5 }, "kind": "voltage" }` (angles in radians)
- `{ "type": "string", "value": "…" }`, `{ "type": "boolean", "value": true }`
- `{ "type": "array", "value": [<typed values>] }`, `{ "type": "object", "value": { <field>: <typed value> } }`
- `{ "type": "slot", "value": "name" }` — a slot reference (call arguments and set values; expands to a copy — never stored as a reference)

kind names: time, frequency, resistance, capacitance, inductance, voltage, current, power, temperature, angle, pressure, energy, length, mass, log, none, … A bare number is kind `none`; log is a plain ratio. Omit the variant field for the SI base representation; omit prefix for multiplier 1.

variant words: degC/degF (temperature), deg (angle), bar/psi/atm (pressure), cal/Wh (energy), hp (power), inch/foot/yard/mile (length), lb/oz (mass). prefix words: pico/nano/micro/milli/kilo/mega/giga/tera. A prefix is only valid without a variant. Words are ASCII; symbols never enter values.

## Primitives

- `set { name, value }` — write one slot. `value: null` deletes the slot (idempotent). Re-writing with a different kind than the pinned slot kind fails. `value` may be a slot reference: the referenced value is stored as a COPY.
- `get { name }` — read one slot; you receive the value exactly as written.
- `call { solver, args, target }` — call one registered solver. Every argument is a typed value or a slot reference — `{ "type": "slot", "value": "name" }` with the full slot path (`"name"` or `"name.field"`); references may also sit inside array items and object fields, resolving to the stored value before validation. A value solver requires a named `target` (overwriting bumps the slot revision); a void solver takes `target: null`.
- `solver_info { solver }` — inspect one registered solver before its first use: the parameter signature (names, quantity kinds, allowed enums, optional flags, nested items) and `returns` (a spec, or null for void), straight from the registry. A quantity leaf reads `complex(kind)` (a real is a legal complex) or `number(kind)` (reals only — a complex is refused, never narrowed).
- External solvers are registry entries like any other: a declaration in `~/.dsh-reckoner/external-solvers.jsonl` (managed with `external_solver_add` / `external_solver_update` / `external_solver_delete`) is compiled in at host start, so `solver_info` and `call` treat it unchanged, and its failures carry the `EXTERNAL_*` codes. A declaration change needs a host restart.

Every call returns a receipt: `{ ok: true, … }` or `{ ok: false, code, error }`. Failed calls have no side effects; read values only through `get`. Read `solver_info` before the first call of a solver you have not used — guessing parameters from the one-line catalog is how retries happen.

## Record markers

- `record_question { text }` — open a record (table cleared). A re-open seals the previous record as duplicate-start.
- `record_analyse { text }` — the analysis: knowns and the approach with formulas. No computed numbers here.
- `record_answer { text }` — the final answer; seals the record.

Conditions from the question are stored with `set` as typed values (translate the user's wording into typed values yourself — transcription, not calculation). Computed numbers appear only after the `call` that produced them; answers quote slot values or `get` results.

## Discipline

- Numbers in an answer ⇔ slot values produced by `call` results (or conditions stored by `set`).
- Transcription of user wording into typed values is yours; every numerical rule application (prefix, variant, complex conversion) happens inside the engine at the call boundary — never convert in prose or in arguments by hand.
- `call` arguments are typed values exactly like `set` values — an enum string is `{ "type": "string", "value": "rc" }`, a number is `{ "type": "number", "value": 100, "kind": "resistance" }`, an array is `{ "type": "array", "value": [...] }` (or a slot reference to a slot holding it). Run `solver_info` first: its `signature` field lists every parameter with a ready-to-send example.
- A failed receipt (`ok: false`) leaves no state behind: read the code, fix the call, retry.
