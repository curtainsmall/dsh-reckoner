# ElectroLab Engine Manual

[简体中文](engine.zh-CN.md)

The DeepSeek Harness ElectroLab plugin runs all electrical & electronics calculation inside a deterministic **engine**. The language model never computes: it operates the engine through three primitives and three record markers, and the engine keeps a typed-value table, converts values at calculation boundaries, records every step, and seals each solve into a browsable record.

This manual is the full reference for the engine surface — typed values, primitives, markers, the solver catalog, and storage. Sessions started in **ElectroLab Mode** carry the same rules in the `electro-lab-interface` skill (engine manual) and `electro-lab-template` skill (record protocol).

## 1. How it works

- **One global engine per host process.** Any session's markers act on the same engine; at most one record is open at a time (single-open invariant).
- **The LLM surface is seven tools**: `set`, `get`, `call`, `solver_info`, `record_question`, `record_analyse`, `record_answer`. The ~40 domain tools, `solve_steps` and the text↔value codecs are gone; the math kernels live in the engine's solver registry and are invoked by `call`. `solver_info` exposes a solver's exact signature (parameter names, quantity kinds, allowed enums, optional flags, returns) straight from the registry — read it before calling an unfamiliar solver.
- **A record is a process (timeline).** Each engine operation appends one fully self-describing trace line (input and output both stored); a record can be replayed to rebuild the recorded state at any point without re-computing anything.
- **Input is value.** What the model gives is what the engine stores; a string stays a string.

## 2. Typed values

A typed value is a JSON object. `kind` is part of a quantity:

```json
{ "type": "number",  "value": 100,  "kind": "resistance" }
{ "type": "number",  "value": 25,   "kind": "temperature", "variant": "degC" }
{ "type": "number",  "value": 1500, "kind": "resistance",  "prefix": "kilo" }
{ "type": "complex", "value": { "re": 100, "im": 0 }, "kind": "voltage" }
{ "type": "complex", "value": { "mag": 220, "ang": 0.5236 }, "kind": "voltage" }
{ "type": "string",  "value": "lowpass" }
{ "type": "boolean", "value": true }
```

- `type` — the shape discriminator: number / complex / string / boolean / array (items recurse) / object (fields recurse). A `slot` value (`{ "type": "slot", "value": "…" }`) is a reference resolved at the call/set boundary to a copy of the referenced value — it is never stored or returned (§3).
- `kind` — the quantity class (resistance, voltage, time, frequency, temperature, angle, pressure, energy, length, mass, log, none, …). Kind is part of a quantity: a value exists with a kind; a bare number has kind `none`; a plain ratio has kind `log`.
- `variant` — a representation choice *within* a kind. **Field absent (not null) = the SI base representation**; storage never adds keys. Only the following words are valid, and each only on its own kind:

| kind | variant words | base (no key) |
|---|---|---|
| temperature | degC, degF | K |
| angle | deg | rad |
| pressure | bar, psi, atm | Pa |
| energy | cal, Wh | J |
| power | hp | W |
| length | inch, foot, yard, mile | m |
| mass | lb, oz | kg |

- `prefix` — a magnitude multiplier on number/complex. **Field absent = multiplier 1.** Words are full lowercase English words, never symbols: `pico` `nano` `micro` `milli` `kilo` `mega` `giga` `tera`. A prefix is generally only valid on the SI base representation (variant words reject prefixes).
- Words are short ASCII text everywhere; symbols (Ω, °, µ, …) never enter the value universe.

### Conversion boundary

The table stores values **exactly as given** — `get` returns what `set` wrote, no normalization. Conversion happens only when a value is *referenced by a computation*: at the `call` boundary the engine converts variants to SI (degC → K, deg → rad, psi → Pa, …) and normalizes complex shapes (`{mag, ang}` → `{re, im}`, angles always radians). The table is untouched; the trace records both the original args and the resolved end values.

## 3. Primitives

```
set  { name, value }     write one slot: value = a typed value; value: null deletes the slot
get  { name }            read one slot (the stored typed value, exactly as written)
call { solver, args, target }  call one registered solver; args values are typed values or slot references like { "type": "slot", "value": "R" }
solver_info { solver }        inspect a solver's signature (parameters, enums, returns) before calling it
```

Semantics:

- `"100 kΩ"` is always a string; a resistance of 100 kΩ must be given as `{ "type": "number", "value": 100, "kind": "resistance", "prefix": "kilo" }`.
- A slot reference is its own typed value: `{ "type": "slot", "value": "name" }`, where `value` is the full slot path (`"name"` or `"name.field"`). The engine expands it and kind/shape-checks it against the solver signature; a reference to a missing slot fails with `ENGINE_SLOT_UNDECLARED`. References may also sit inside array items and object fields of an argument or set value, resolving to the stored value before validation — `set` stores the resolved COPY, so later changes to the source slot do not affect the copy. Slot references exist only at the call/set boundary — they are never stored in the table, never returned, and a bare string is always a literal string, never a reference.
- **Every call returns one receipt** — there is no "exception vs normal return" duality:

```
success: set  → { ok: true, name, rev }   (delete: { ok: true, name, deleted })
         get  → { ok: true, name, value }
         call → { ok: true, target, rev }  (void solver: { ok: true, target: null })
failure:      → { ok: false, code, error }
```

  Check `ok` first. Receipts carry no business data (except `get`); read values only through `get`.
- **target matches the solver signature** (the engine decides from the registry; the model does not need to remember rules): a void solver (declared `returns: null`) takes `target: null` (a named target → `ENGINE_VOID_TARGET`); a value solver requires a named target (missing/null → `ENGINE_TARGET_REQUIRED`).
- **target always overwrites**: writing an existing slot replaces the whole value (kind check passes) and bumps `rev`; nothing is inherited from the old representation.
- **Delete = `set` with `value: null`**: the slot disappears from the table, deleting a missing slot is an idempotent ok, re-creating later restarts at rev 1; the trace line carries `deleted: true`.
- Slot kinds are pinned on first write: overwriting with a different kind fails (`ENGINE_KIND_MISMATCH`) and does not advance the revision.
- Failed operations have **no side effects**: no slot is created, the table does not change, revisions do not move. The failure still lands in the trace.

## 4. Records & markers

```
record_question { text }    open a record (clears the table); a re-open seals the previous record as duplicate-start
record_analyse  { text }    the analysis: knowns and the approach with formulas — no computed numbers
record_answer   { text }    the final answer; seals the record
```

- One open record at most. A second `record_question` seals the open record (duplicate-start) and starts a new one — two open rows can never exist.
- `record_answer` with no open record keeps a duplicate-end error record.
- An interrupted record (index `sealedAt: null` with a body file) is resumed at the next engine start: the trace continues in the same file and the table is rebuilt from it. An incomplete record never completes itself — it is either sealed later (duplicate-start) or stays incomplete forever.

## 5. Solver catalog

All solvers speak the same value contract: quantity arguments are typed values (see §2); array coefficients of transfer functions are kind-`none` quantities in descending power order. The catalog mirrors the math kernels one-to-one.

### Solver surface notes

The solver surface is exactly the migrated kernels under the engine's one-shape-per-solver returns discipline. The notable consequences:

- `reflection_to_vswr` / `return_loss`: the |Γ| = 1 / |Γ| = 0 extremes are unbounded — the value universe holds no infinity, so those calls throw.
- `circuit_impedance.network` is a JSON-text string (a closed spec cannot express a recursive heterogeneous tree).
- `resonance.resistance` is required and the result always carries qualityFactor and bandwidth.
- `filter_design.queryFrequency` is required (pass the cutoff frequency when only the design is wanted); element magnitudes are kind-`none` values whose unit is carried by the element kind string.
- `opamp_configurations` covers the six single-input configurations (a summing amplifier has no single gain).
- `transient_response` returns one fixed point shape ({time, voltage, current}) across rc/rl/rlc; the rlc damping characterization is not returned.
- `voltage_divider` returns a fixed four-field object; unloaded, `unloadedOutputVoltage` equals `outputVoltage` and `loadCurrent` is 0.
- `series_sum` returns one fixed shape (kind/power/sum/lastTerm/converges) across all branches; a diverging infinite input errors.
- Unit-carrying echo fields follow the legacy declarations and use kind `none` (kelvin temperatures, wavelengths, coaxial diameters, echo frequency lists) — typed values for those quantities are SI base numbers.

### External solvers

The registry also holds solvers registered from declarations: `external-solvers.jsonl` keeps one JSON declaration per line, and at engine start every enabled declaration with a mappable `returns` is compiled into the same registry the built-ins occupy. For the engine there is no difference afterwards — the declaration's `parameters` and `returns` are the signature, so `solver_info` and `call` work unchanged, the resolved arguments leave as typed values (SI, rect, no variant/prefix words), and the returned value is validated against the declared `returns` before it enters the table. A call line in the trace reads exactly like a kernel call's.

The transport is a POST-only typed envelope: `{requestId, args}` → `{requestId, result}` (`null` for a void solver) or `{requestId, error}`; the endpoint URL, extra headers and the timeout (default 30 s) come from the declaration's transport options. Failures keep the interface's own meaning — `EXTERNAL_ERROR` (the endpoint reported it in the envelope), `EXTERNAL_HTTP` (a non-2xx status), `EXTERNAL_TIMEOUT` (the declaration's timeout), `EXTERNAL_RESPONSE` (the envelope or the value broke the contract) — and land in the trace as a failed call line, like every other failure.

## 6. Storage

The plugin home is `~/.dsh-electro-lab` (override with the `DSH_ELECTRO_LAB_HOME` environment variable):

```
~/.dsh-electro-lab/
  record-index.jsonl     ← index (outside records/)
  records/
    <id>.jsonl           ← the trace body (id is a UUID v4)
  state.json             ← plugin state: generation settings + restart flag
  external-solvers.jsonl ← external solver declarations (one JSON per line)
  logs/
    <YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.SSS>.log   ← one host run, plain event lines
```

### record-index.jsonl (index only)

```json
{ "id": "…", "openedAt": 1730000000000, "sealedAt": null, "question": "given R = 100ohm…" }
```

Fields: id, openedAt, sealedAt (null = not sealed), question (immutable title). No errors, no stats, no content; line order is append order. Truncation is the UI's job.

### Trace body (per-step, full)

One line per engine operation or marker; every line carries everything needed to restore that step — input and output both:

```json
{ "seq": 1, "tool": "marker", "kind": "question", "ok": true, "text": "…", "at": … }
{ "seq": 2, "tool": "set", "ok": true, "name": "R", "value": { …typed value as given… }, "rev": 1, "at": … }
{ "seq": 3, "tool": "call", "ok": true, "solver": "resonance",
  "args": { …original… }, "resolved": { …expanded + SI/rect end values… },
  "result": { …typed output… }, "target": "res", "rev": 1, "at": … }
{ "seq": 4, "tool": "call", "ok": false, "code": "ENGINE_SLOT_UNDECLARED", "error": "…", "at": … }
{ "seq": 5, "tool": "set", "ok": true, "name": "tmp", "value": null, "deleted": true, "at": … }
{ "seq": 6, "tool": "marker", "kind": "answer", "ok": true, "text": "…", "at": … }
```

- `call` lines store the result: any call's output enters the line as fact — restoring state uses the stored result directly and **never recomputes**.
- `resolved` is the argument set that actually entered the run: references expanded and all conversions done (SI, rect). `args` keeps the originals; the two line up per key.
- No kernel-internal intermediate steps and no model reasoning text are recorded; the granularity is one engine operation. The reader of a trace is a human — every step shows original input, converted values and result in place, and can be re-verified independently.

### Restore = replay

Rebuilding state replays the lines in order: `set` lines set the slot to the stored value, `call` lines set the target slot to the stored result (non-void), set-null lines delete, marker lines are skipped. Pure engine — no recompute, no network, no randomness.

### Consistency

- Orphan index rows (sealedAt null without a body file) are cleared at engine start — the index is a projection and can be safely rebuilt.
- The open record is the index row with `sealedAt: null` whose body exists; a restart recovers it from that pair, not from a pointer file.
- Old-format `records.jsonl` / `open-record.json` are not read; leftovers are ignored and safe to delete.

### state.json (plugin state)

The plugin's own state: the generation dialog's settings (`generateDir`, `generateLanguage`, `generateFormat`, `generateCompile`) and the external-declaration restart flag (`restartRequired`, cleared once declarations are registered at start). Writes go through one owner module as read-modify-write, so a writer touches only its own keys, and the file is replaced atomically (temporary file + rename), so a crash mid-write leaves the previous file intact. An unreadable file reads as `{}`.

### external-solvers.jsonl (declarations)

One JSON declaration per line: `name`, `description`, `enabled`, `parameters`, `returns`, `transport` and `transportOptions` (endpoint URL, extra headers, timeout). `returns` is what registers the solver — a spec, or `null` for a void one; a declaration without a mappable `returns` is archived but skipped at start with a warning, and `enabled: false` is skipped silently. The file is read once at mount: the manager tools and the archive endpoint write it and set the restart flag in state.json, never the live registry.

### logs/ (one file per host run)

One file per plugin mount: `<logs>/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.SSS>.log`, created exclusively and held open. Lines are `<timestamp> <LEVEL> <message>[ k=v …]`, written to the file and to stdout. Field values are JSON types expanded one level — a nested object or array is one token — and an Error becomes its message plus `  | ` continuation lines with the stack. `DSH_ELECTRO_LAB_LOG_LEVEL` (`debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` | `off`, default `info`) is the only setting; the newest 20 files up to 50 MB are kept.

The file is the run's whole record: the name is the start, the last line is the end, and a log whose last line is not `plugin unmounted` is a run that was killed. Transport facts (endpoint, request id, elapsed time) are logged, never written to a record.

## 7. Host endpoints

- `GET /api/dsh-electro-lab/records-index` — the index rows for the Records panel list (`{ rows: [{ id, openedAt, sealedAt, question }] }`). The list polls every 5 s; it never reads trace bodies.
- `/api/dsh-electro-lab/external-solvers` — the declaration archive. `GET` lists the declarations plus the restart flag, `PUT` adds or replaces one from base64url JSON in the `config` query parameter, `DELETE ?name=` removes one. Every write sets the restart flag.
